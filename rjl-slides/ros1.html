# What does Reproducible Research mean?

### .blue[Ability to determine exactly how scientific results were obtained.]

 - Basis of scientific method.

 - Required for confidently building on past results.

 - Critical for accountability in engineering analysis / decision making.

---

template: meaning1

### .red[Standards and best practices in computational/data science are not yet well codified.]

 - Experimental science: Lab notebooks, methodology section of publications, etc.

 - Mathematics: Proofs are required in publications.

Quote from .blue[Reproducible Research: A Cautionary Tale]

By David Crotty, March 26, 2014 on the [scholarly kitchen blog](??)


.red["If your experiment consists of running numerical data through an algorithm,
then releasing your data and your code allows others to quickly verify that
you’ve done what you’ve said you’ve done.]
But when it comes to other types of research, 
wet bench experiments or observational
work for example, reproduction is not quite so simple."

## Outline

 - .blue[Goal:] Stimulate discussion and share ideas  

     - Types of reproducibility
     - Tools for reproducibility

 - .blue[Data:] archiving, curation, sharing
 - .blue[Code:] scripting, versioning, collaborating, sharing

---

name: private1

## Private reproducibility...

Use scripts, not GUIs, for data analysis and visualization. 

Use version control / provenance tracking tools.

Archive code and data used for published results.

.blue[Why?]

 - Ability to check results in prior publication,

 - Ability to build on your own past research of your own
   (or students / collaborators).

 -  Easily modify tables/figures to satisfy referees, etc.

---

template: private1

#### .red[Auditable Research:] 
Even if code and data are not shared, there should be a
permanent record that can be checked.

.blue[Analogous to lab notebooks.]

### Version control does *not* mean...

---

## Public Reproducibility...

Allowing others to reproduce your results. 

(Readers, referees, researchers down the hall...)


.blue[Why?]

 -  Verifying scientific integrity of results.

 -  Aids in understanding ideas, implementing methods 

 -  Increases impact of work.

## Data Curation

### [Ten Simple Rules for the Care and Feeding of Scientific Data](http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003542)

 - Rule 2.  Share Your Data Online, with a Permanent Identifier 

 - Rule 4. Publish Workflow as Context

 - Rule 5. Link Your Data to Your Publications as Often as Possible

 - Rule 6. Publish Your Code (Even the Small Bits) 

 - Rule 7. State How You Want to Get Credit

 - Rule 8. Foster and Use Data Repositories

## Data Repositories

 -  .blue[DesignSafe:] https://www.designsafe-ci.org/ <br>

 -  .blue[Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System]<br>
    (CSDMS): http://csdms.colorado.edu Data and model repositories,<br>
    Web interface to some models

 -  .blue[Open Science Framework:] https://osf.io/ <br>
    Ex: April 12 talk by Kara Woo in
    eScience Reproducibility and Open Science Seminar

 - .blue[UW ResearchWorks:] https://researchworks.lib.washington.edu/ <br>
   Ex: Ocosta School tsunami study, 
   https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/24054

 - .blue[figshare:] https://figshare.com/ <br>
   Ex: Search for tsunami

 - .blue[Zenodo:] https://zenodo.org/ <br>
   Ex: Data and code for journal article on PTHA, <br>
